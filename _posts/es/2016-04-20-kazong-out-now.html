            <h4 class="bold">We are 3 friends, Kazong is our 1st mobile App ... we spend all our time on developing &amp; playing Kazong in a backyard office in Berlin. All that just started with joking around</h4><br>
            <p class="history-initial">While we were watching the TV show “Beat the Star”. We were bragging to each other: ‘I would easily beat you . . .’ ‘You wouldn't stand a chance . . .’, and so we decided to put our money where are mouths were by developing an app where we could compete in such games. Things rapidly developed, and from there Kazong was born.</p>
