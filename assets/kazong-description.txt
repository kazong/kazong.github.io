HISTORY
==============================
Everything started with joking around ... while we were watching the TV show “Beat the Star” we were bragging to each other ‘I would easily beat you…’, ‘You wouldn't stand a chance…’, and so we decided to put our money where are mouths were by developing an app where we could compete in such Mini-Games. Things rapidly developed, and from there Kazong was born.
